1. What are the library dependencies that people need to make sure they have
in order to run apsimx.R?

2. How can I fix the file path stuff (like `.env`) to make the tool easier to use?

3.a Do people have to edit `selected_crop.txt` whenever they run the tool?
3.b Should I add editing `selected_crop.txt` to the README instructions for running?

4. Are there any other ways to run the tool, such as the web app, and
should I add instructions / links to running it that way?

5. How do I interpret the output? Add this to README after the run instructions.

6. Add a Liscence (probably MIT)

7. Do I need a .gitignore?

8. Should I add a `.Rprofile` (run on project startup)?

9. If I want to add helper functions, define them in ./R/ (like ./R/01-fname.R)

10. Make sure there is a (well-named) top-level R script to run everything.

11. Should I add an ./renv/ folder to save package versions using renv::init()?

12. Should I add some `project.Rproj` file to make this a valid RStudio project?
