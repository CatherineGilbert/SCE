- Get the progress bar working, or get the console outputs as a progress indicator. ("What is the tool currently doing?")
- Refactor the app code to remove redunancies. We do not need to be continually recalculating bigmet. 
- Rewrite the visualization code to take advantage of the start/end dates and thermal times as recorded variables when possible. This should simplify some of the calculations. 
- Get all the TT/Precip analysis as subheadings under one tab. 
- Get final_x working as a dataset in the Result viz/bar chart section. 
- Figure out why some trials are not displaying correctly in the TT/Precip progress chart. 
- Change the size of the top bars so they match. Change the size of the app window when it opens.
